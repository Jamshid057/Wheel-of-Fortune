Pole Chudes (Wheel of Fortune) — C Console Game
📌 Description

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic game "Pole Chudes" (known internationally as "Wheel of
Fortune"), written entirely in C programming language.

The player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Correct guesses reveal letters in the word, while incorrect
guesses reduce the number of attempts. The goal is to guess the full word before running out of attempts.

This project was created as a learning and practice project to improve skills in C programming, file handling, loops,
conditions, and basic game logic.
